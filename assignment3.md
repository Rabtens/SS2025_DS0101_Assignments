## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: GitHub Repository Setup

- Verified public repository visibility  
- Committed all required files  
- Confirmed presence of application source code  

#### `package.json` Scripts:
```json
{
  "name": "todo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/app.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "dev": "nodemon src/app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.0.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }
}
```
### Task 2: Docker Configuration

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js LTS
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all files
COPY . .

# Run tests (optional)
RUN npm test

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
### Local Testing
- Built Docker image: docker build -t todo-app .

- Ran container: docker run -p 3000:3000 todo-app

- Verified application at localhost:3000

### Task 3: GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to Render

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/todo-app:latest .
          docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/todo-app:latest

      - name: Trigger Render Deployment
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}
```

### GitHub Secrets
- DOCKERHUB_USERNAME

- DOCKERHUB_TOKEN

- RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL

### Task 4: Render.com Deployment Setup
### Web Service Configuration
- Name: todo-app-deployment

- Region: Oregon (US West)

- Instance Type: Free Tier

- Port: 3000

- Env Vars: NODE_ENV=production

### Deployment Webhook
- Generated from Render dashboard

- Added to GitHub secrets as RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL

### Configuration Files Summary
### Dockerfile
- Uses node:20-alpine for lightweight image

- Runs tests during build

- Follows Docker best practices

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Trigger: Push to main branch

- Actions:

    - Builds and pushes image to DockerHub

    - Deploys using Render webhook

### Challenges Faced
### Technical
- DockerHub Authentication: Solved using token-based login

- Render Webhook: Triggered with curl

- Build Optimization: Alpine image used with Docker caching

- Docker Testing: Refined to match production

### Configuration
- YAML Syntax: Validated online

- Environment Variables: Configured correctly

- Port Issues: Ensured consistency across app, Dockerfile, and Render

### Results and Screenshots

### GitHub Actions
- Workflow passed  
- Execution time: 2â€“3 mins  
- Auto-trigger verified  

### DockerHub
- Image pushed: ~150MB  
- Tagged as `latest`  

### Render.com
- Deployed successfully  
- Health checks passed  
- Live app available  

### Screenshots (to be added)
- GitHub Actions logs  
- DockerHub repository  
- Render dashboard  
- Live app URL
