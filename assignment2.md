## Pipeline Configuration

### Pipeline Stages

The Jenkins pipeline consists of 5 main stages:

1. **Checkout Stage**  
   - Pulls the latest code from GitHub repository  
   - Uses the main branch as the source  

2. **Install Dependencies Stage**  
   - Runs `npm install` to install all project dependencies  
   - Downloads packages listed in `package.json`  

3. **Build Stage**  
   - Executes `npm run build` command  
   - Compiles the application for production  

4. **Test Stage**  
   - Runs unit tests using `npm test`  
   - Generates test reports in JUnit format  
   - Publishes test results to Jenkins  

5. **Deploy Stage**  
   - Builds Docker image of the application  
   - Pushes the image to Docker Hub registry  
   - Makes the application ready for deployment  

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Jenkins Setup
- Downloaded and installed Jenkins from [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io)  
- Accessed Jenkins web interface at `localhost:8080`  
- Completed initial setup wizard  
- Created admin user account  

### Step 2: Plugin Installation
Installed the following Jenkins plugins:
- NodeJS Plugin
- Pipeline Plugin
- GitHub Integration Plugin
- Docker Pipeline Plugin

### Step 3: Tool Configuration
- Configured Node.js in Jenkins under **Manage Jenkins > Tools**
- Set up Node.js LTS v20.x with automatic npm installation
- Verified tool configuration was successful

### Step 4: GitHub Repository Setup
- Ensured Node.js application code was pushed to GitHub  
- Generated Personal Access Token (PAT) with:
  - `repo` access
  - `admin:repo_hook` permissions  
- Added GitHub credentials to Jenkins credential store

### Step 5: `package.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --ci --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit",
    "build": "npm run build-script",
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```
### Step 6: Testing Framework Setup

- Installed Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`  
- Installed jest-junit: `npm install --save-dev jest-junit`  
- Created test files with proper test cases  

### Step 7: Jenkinsfile Creation

- Created Jenkinsfile with:  
  - Declarative pipeline syntax  
  - Error handling  
  - Post-build actions for test reporting  

### Step 8: Pipeline Job Creation

- Created new Pipeline job in Jenkins  
- Configured SCM to GitHub  
- Set up webhook for auto builds  
- Tested pipeline execution

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges

- **Node.js Plugin Configuration**  
  - *Problem*: npm not found  
  - *Solution*: Configured Node.js tool, updated PATH  

- **GitHub Authentication**  
  - *Problem*: Permission denied  
  - *Solution*: Used PAT with correct permissions  

- **Test Report Generation**  
  - *Problem*: Reports not visible  
  - *Solution*: Installed `jest-junit`, configured Jest  

- **Docker Integration**  
  - *Problem*: Docker commands failed  
  - *Solution*: Verified Docker installation and permissions  

### Configuration Challenges

- **Pipeline Syntax Errors**  
  - *Problem*: Syntax errors in Jenkinsfile  
  - *Solution*: Used syntax validator  

- **Build Script Issues**  
  - *Problem*: `npm run build` failed  
  - *Solution*: Added missing build script in `package.json`
